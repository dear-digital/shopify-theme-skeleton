# ðŸŒŸ Rewards and Contributions Guide for Skeleton Shopify Theme

## Introduction
Welcome to the Skeleton Shopify Theme project! Our evolving rewards system is designed to ensure the project's sustainability while valuing the contributions of our community. We've refined our approach to focus on recognition through points and selective monetary rewards for critical contributions.

## Contribution and Issue Tracking
Your innovative issues and feature suggestions are crucial to enhancing our theme. Our current focus includes implementing Nested Blocks and improving functionality and user experience.

### Points System Update
- **Bounty Labels**: Monetary rewards are now exclusive to issues marked with a "bounty" label, reflecting the importance and immediate project needs. These labels and the associated rewards are at the discretion of the repository maintainers.
- **Points Recognition**: Contributions not eligible for monetary rewards will still earn points, serving as valuable recognition of your efforts and dedication.

### Monetary Compensation
- **Selective Compensation**: Cash rewards will be given for contributions solving "bounty" labeled issues. The rate per point for these bounties is variable and will be determined by the maintainers based on the issue's significance and the project's budget.
- **Disclaimer**: The allocation of points and bounties to issues is entirely up to the repository maintainers. They will allocate these based on their knowledge and discretion, ensuring fairness and relevance to project goals.

## Looking Ahead
The points you accumulate symbolize your engagement and contribution to our community. They could lead to future opportunities, such as potential employment or participation in sponsored projects with bounty rewards.

## Conclusion
This updated rewards system underscores our commitment to a sustainable open-source ecosystem and our appreciation for every contributor's hard work. We're excited about the community's growth and continued innovation. Let's make the Skeleton Shopify Theme the best foundation for Shopify developers.

<sub>Note: This revised rewards and points system applies to all issues. The allocation of points and bounty rates is subject to the discretion of repository maintainers, ensuring adaptability and alignment with project needs.</sub>

This approach aims to maintain project sustainability while acknowledging and rewarding the invaluable contributions of our community members.
